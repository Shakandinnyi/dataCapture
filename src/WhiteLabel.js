<p > Are you a municipality, town, university, mall or city and would like to have your own app with your own branding that citizens can interact. You can white label this app and make it your own. No site hosting or maintenance, we do it all.
<br/><br/>
The app works by identifying the location the photo is taken using the phone's GPS data. It sends an email to the municipality from the user's email address, including the incident type, notes, address of incident, photo and the user's contact details. The report is then allocated to the relevant municipal department. The more information provided, the better we can help isolate and investigate the issue.
<br/><br/>

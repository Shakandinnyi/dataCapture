<p > If you spot something in your district such as a pothole, vandalism, litter or damaged gravelroads, you can report it instantly to your local municipality from a mobile phone.
<br/><br/>
The app works by identifying the location the photo is taken using the phone's GPS data. It sends an email to the municipality from the user's email address, including the incident type, notes, address of incident, photo and the user's contact details. The report is then allocated to the relevant municipal department. The more information provided, the better we can help isolate and investigate the issue.
<br/><br/>
How does it work?<br/><br/>
1. Tap Report to file a report<br/>
2. Upload your photos<br/>
3. Choose an Incident Type<br/>
4. Include your details<br/>
5. Tap Send while you are on-site to get the correct GPS location<br/>
6. The municipality receives an email with your report and a service request is generated.<br/><br/>

How much will sending a DataCapture report cost me?<br/><br/>
The DataCaptureapp itself is free to use. When sending a report, the app will communicate with the data centre to obtain the correct municipality information and will then send an email to the municipality, which may use a small amount of your mobile data.
<br/><br/>
Is there a potential for messages to be delayed?<br/><br/>
Our platform and municipality systems is reliant upon the internet email systems. Delays in the delivery of email messages may occur but this is beyond the control of the Municipality. If your issue is urgent, you should ring the relevant emergency service provider </p>
